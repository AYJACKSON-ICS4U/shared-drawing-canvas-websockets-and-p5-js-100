### A. What I have learned?
* I learned a ton about node and why its helpful. 
* I learned how to send in receive information between computers
* I learned how to create a server and see when people connect to it
* I also learn a little about client server interactions
 
### B. What I still don't know?
* I still don't know how to introduce complex things from nature of code to here
* I would like to learn how to make games like pong with a shared server like think
* I would also like to know how to make a server host that everyone can connect to, not just local

### C. Creative Ideas you might want to try?
 - I am going to try to make it so the ellipse in the draw grows as you draw until it reaches a point and then the size resets
 - Maybe one day I will try to make pong with a server
 - Maybe A 2D game for 2 players

### Things I had to figure out on my own
- When I first followed the tutorial the code did not run for me. I was not sure why until I change the name of my html file to index and the problem was solved. When server.js runs it looks for index and not just any html file.
- I also had to find the best way to include the ellipse that grows in size but I was able to do that pretty fast
- The last think I had to figure out is were to run it because I was using a windows computer and not a mac I wasn't sure if command prompt would work but at the end I got it to work with command prompt.
